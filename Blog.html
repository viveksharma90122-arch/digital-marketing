    <p>Life doesn’t always follow the path you imagine—but sometimes, that’s exactly where the magic happens. I started my career with a focus on technology, pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Applications (BCA), and then went on to complete my MCA. While the world of programming and development fascinated me, I discovered something even more exciting: **digital marketing**.</p>

    <h2>👨‍💻 The Turning Point</h2>
    <p>During my MCA, I began exploring SEO, content marketing, and brand-building. It all started when I tried optimizing my own social media presence and noticed small improvements with every tweak. The more I learned, the more I loved the creativity and strategy behind digital growth.</p>

    <h2>🎯 My First Break: Shiva Web Tech</h2>
    <p>In 2025, I landed my first digital marketing internship at <strong>Shiva Web Tech</strong> in Mohali. It was a real-world learning experience. I got hands-on exposure to SEO tools like Google Analytics, Search Console, and even ran social campaigns for clients. Each day brought new challenges and opportunities to grow.</p>

    <h2>📈 Building My Personal Brand</h2>
    <p>I didn’t just want to learn—I wanted to apply what I learned to something personal. So I built this website you're reading now, to showcase my skills and share my journey. I also started writing blog posts, sharing insights on digital trends, and connecting with professionals via LinkedIn.</p>

    <h2>💡 My Advice to New Digital Marketers</h2>
    <p>Start small. Whether it's your own portfolio, a friend’s business, or a case study—begin somewhere. Learn tools like Canva, Semrush, Mailchimp, and WordPress. Be curious. Read blogs. Test everything. And most importantly, be consistent. Digital marketing isn’t just about ads and keywords—it’s about storytelling and trust.</p>

    <p>Today, I’m proud of how far I’ve come—from a coding student to a confident digital strategist. My mission is to continue helping businesses grow online and inspire others to embrace this evolving field.</p>

    <p>If you're just starting out, know this: **you don’t need to be perfect—you just need to begin.**</p>
