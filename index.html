    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! I’m Vivek Sharma, a passionate and aspiring digital marketing professional with a vision to build a successful career in the dynamic world of online marketing. 
      I have completed my Master of Computer Applications (MCA) and am currently working as a Digital Marketing Intern at Shiva Web Tech in Mohali. 
      My academic background includes a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Applications, which gave me a strong foundation in technology, programming, and problem-solving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, I discovered my interest in the creative and analytical side of the digital world. 
      While working on projects and learning new tools, I realized that digital marketing combines both creativity and data-driven strategies. 
      It is this blend of art and science that inspired me to pursue a career in this field. 
      At Shiva Web Tech, I have been gaining hands-on experience in Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Social Media Management, Content Marketing, 
      and various other aspects of digital growth. This internship has given me the opportunity to understand how online businesses operate 
      and how strategic campaigns can help brands reach the right audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      My journey has also included roles such as Data Analyst at Adreno Technologies and Customer Service Associate at Teleperformance, 
      which improved my skills in communication, teamwork, data interpretation, and understanding user needs. 
      These roles taught me patience and adaptability—qualities that are essential for any professional who wishes to grow in a fast-paced digital environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      My key skills include SEO (On-Page, Off-Page, and Technical), using tools like Google Analytics and Google Search Console, 
      keyword research, writing SEO-friendly content, and creating engaging designs on platforms like Canva. 
      I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to think creatively and strategically at the same time. 
      My goal is to build my expertise in digital marketing and become a versatile professional who can help businesses 
      improve their online presence through ethical and innovative strategies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of work and studies, I am deeply interested in personal branding, networking, and continuous learning. 
      I believe that in today’s digital era, knowledge and adaptability are the keys to growth. 
      Through my personal website, I aim to share my journey, showcase my projects, and connect with people who have similar interests in technology and marketing.
