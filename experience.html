    <h2>Experience</h2>

    <h3>Digital Marketing Intern – Shivah Web Tech (Jul 2025 – Present)</h3>
    <p>
      During my ongoing internship at Shivah Web Tech, I am gaining in-depth knowledge and hands-on
      experience in digital marketing strategies. My primary focus has been on SEO optimization, keyword research,
      on-page and off-page techniques, content creation, and analytics. I actively work on social media management,
      designing engaging creatives using Canva, and monitoring campaign performance using tools like Google Analytics
      and Google Search Console.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this role, I have been exposed to real-world client projects where I assist in planning, executing,
      and optimizing online campaigns to boost brand visibility. This internship has strengthened my analytical and
      creative skills, teaching me how to combine data insights with innovative marketing strategies for maximum impact.
    </p>

    <h3>Data Analyst – Adreno Technologies (May – Jun 2023)</h3>
    <p>
      As a Data Analyst intern, I worked on data cleaning, organizing, and interpreting datasets to support internal
      decision-making processes. I developed reports and dashboards to visualize patterns and insights, helping
      teams better understand customer behaviors and trends.
    </p>
    <p>
      This experience gave me an opportunity to apply my analytical skills, enhance my knowledge of Excel and basic
      data tools, and understand how data-driven decision-making impacts overall business strategies.
    </p>

    <h3>Customer Service Associate – Teleperformance (Feb – Mar 2023)</h3>
    <p>
      Working at Teleperformance taught me the importance of communication, patience, and problem-solving in a
      fast-paced environment. My responsibilities included assisting customers with queries, resolving issues,
      and ensuring customer satisfaction while following company protocols.
    </p>
    <p>
      This role honed my interpersonal skills and adaptability, qualities that continue to help me in every
      professional role I take on.
