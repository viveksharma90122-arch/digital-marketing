    <h2>Highlighted Projects</h2>

    <h3>One-to-One Chat System (C#)</h3>
    <p>
      This was one of my favorite projects during my MCA, where I developed a real-time one-to-one chat system using C# and socket programming. 
      The aim of this project was to create a desktop-based application that allows two users to communicate securely over a network. 
      The backend handled all the message routing, ensuring that communication remained fast and reliable. 
      A lot of effort went into designing the interface so that it was simple and user-friendly, with a clean layout and modern color scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project was a turning point for me because it introduced me to concepts like multithreading, 
      asynchronous communication, and encryption for data security. 
      By implementing these features, the system was not only responsive but also secure enough to be used in real-world scenarios for private messaging. 
      Through debugging network issues and ensuring stable connections, I learned how crucial error handling is in real-time systems. 
      This experience gave me a much deeper appreciation of both backend network programming and creating smooth user experiences.
    </p>

    <h3>Student Report Card (Java)</h3>
    <p>
      The Student Report Card project was developed as a Java desktop application during my academic journey. 
      Its purpose was to simplify the tedious process of calculating marks, grades, and overall student performance. 
      This application allowed teachers to input scores for various subjects, and the system automatically computed totals, averages, and grades based on predefined logic. 
      I used Java Swing for building the graphical user interface, ensuring that it was interactive and easy to navigate.
    </p>
    <p>
      While working on this project, I also explored file handling in Java to store student data securely, 
      making sure the information could be retrieved easily whenever needed. 
      It was an excellent way to understand data validation, modular programming, and object-oriented design principles. 
      This project taught me to think not only as a developer but also from the user’s perspective, 
      making sure that the software was intuitive and practical for teachers and students alike.
    </p>

    <h3>Bank Management System (Python)</h3>
    <p>
      Another major project that I worked on was the Bank Management System built using Python. 
      The goal was to simulate basic banking functions like account creation, deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking. 
      To store data, I created a file-based database using Python’s built-in file handling, ensuring that every transaction was recorded for future reference.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project gave me an opportunity to apply structured programming techniques while also learning about error handling, 
      exception management, and menu-driven programming. 
      I also designed a text-based user interface that was simple but effective. 
      In addition to technical learning, this project improved my problem-solving skills and gave me a chance to practice debugging in Python. 
      I realized how important it is to write maintainable code that can be easily updated for future requirements, 
      such as adding new features like loan management or interest calculations.
    </p>

    <p>
      These projects, though academic in nature, have shaped my understanding of how software systems are built from scratch. 
      Each project challenged me in different ways and gave me confidence to work on real-world tasks, 
      making me ready to handle both technical and analytical challenges in the professional world.
