  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8; color: #333;">
    Hello and welcome to my website! Iâ€™m Vivek Sharma, a passionate and driven Digital Marketing Professional based in Mohali, India. With a strong academic foundation and real-world experience, I help individuals and businesses create meaningful connections through impactful digital strategies. I recently completed my Master of Computer Applications (MCA) from Chandigarh University via online mode in 2025. This advanced education has not only strengthened my technical understanding of the digital landscape but has also given me a broader perspective on how to leverage technology for marketing and branding success.

    My digital journey began during my postgraduate studies, when I became fascinated with the power of SEO, content strategy, analytics, and personal branding. Instead of sticking solely to development and programming, I chose to explore how brands interact with their audiences online. I started by experimenting with SEO on my own platformsâ€”optimizing my LinkedIn profile, building my personal website, and growing my Instagram presence. The results were immediate and inspiring. I realized I had a flair for storytelling, data-driven content, and audience engagement, which naturally led me into the field of digital marketing.

    Iâ€™m currently working at <a href="https://www.shivahwebtech.com/digital-marketing" target="_blank" style="color:#0077b5; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none;">Shivah Web Tech</a>, a forward-thinking digital marketing agency based in Mohali. As a digital marketing intern, Iâ€™ve been involved in real-time projects that include keyword research, on-page and off-page SEO, running Facebook and Instagram ad campaigns, Google Analytics reporting, and crafting compelling social media strategies. This hands-on experience has helped me learn not only the tools but also the mindset required to succeed in a competitive digital space.

    My core skills include Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Google Search Console, Google Analytics, Meta Business Suite, social media marketing, blogging, WordPress content management, and basic HTML/CSS. I also enjoy designing visuals in Canva and writing engaging, informative blog content. I'm currently building a personal blog section on this website to share insights, trends, and tips for beginners and professionals looking to scale their digital footprint.

    One of the most exciting parts of my journey has been building my personal brand from scratch. I believe in the power of authenticity and consistency. Whether it's crafting a personal bio, selecting the right display image, or optimizing my online profiles, I treat my personal brand like a living project. This practice has helped me understand how to position othersâ€”clients, startups, or professionalsâ€”in the digital world to maximize visibility and trust.

    What sets me apart is my combination of analytical thinking and creative storytelling. I believe digital marketing isnâ€™t just about pushing contentâ€”it's about crafting value. Whether Iâ€™m writing SEO-friendly blogs, managing website audits, creating Instagram reels, or researching keywords, I focus on what truly resonates with the audience. I also value ethics and long-term growth. Thatâ€™s why I stay away from black-hat techniques and always recommend transparent, value-first strategies to my clients and collaborators.

    Iâ€™m a continuous learner who thrives in collaborative environments. I regularly read marketing blogs, listen to digital marketing podcasts, and stay updated with the latest algorithm changes from Google, Instagram, and LinkedIn. I'm currently learning advanced tools like SEMrush, Ahrefs, Mailchimp, and Google Tag Manager to widen my skill set even further. My goal is to become a full-stack digital marketer capable of handling end-to-end growth strategies for brands.

    Outside of work, Iâ€™m a tech enthusiast who enjoys exploring new apps, productivity tools, and automation workflows. I also enjoy writing and speaking about topics like online reputation management, career development, and digital transformation. This website is not just a portfolioâ€”it's a platform where I express ideas, showcase work, and connect with people who share similar interests.

    My dream is to work with ambitious startups, solopreneurs, and organizations that believe in innovation and online-first branding. I want to use my skills to help others succeed in the digital spaceâ€”whether it's ranking on Google, going viral on Instagram, or building a professional LinkedIn profile that attracts recruiters.

    Thank you for taking the time to learn about me. If you're looking to collaborate, need digital marketing support, or simply want to connectâ€”feel free to visit the Contact page. You can also reach out to me via LinkedIn or Instagram. Iâ€™d love to hear your story and see how we can grow together.
