  <h1>How I Started My Digital Marketing Journey After MCA</h1>
  <p class="meta">üóìÔ∏è Published: July 24, 2025 ‚Ä¢ By Vivek Sharma</p>

  <p>Completing my Master of Computer Applications (MCA) in 2025 was a turning point in my career. I had always been interested in technology, but during my studies, I realized I was even more passionate about how tech helps businesses grow ‚Äî especially online.</p>

  <p>While still studying, I began exploring SEO, social media marketing, and content creation. I took some free courses, followed marketing influencers, and practiced by building my own portfolio website ‚Äî the one you're on right now!</p>

  <p>My first opportunity came with <strong>Shiva Web Tech</strong> in Mohali, where I joined as a Digital Marketing Intern. I learned how real campaigns are run ‚Äî from optimizing websites for Google to analyzing traffic using Google Analytics and Search Console.</p>

  <p>Today, I feel more confident in helping brands grow online. I aim to continue learning, experiment with new trends like AI and automation, and eventually build a strong digital brand of my own.</p>

  <p>To anyone who‚Äôs just starting out: be curious, stay consistent, and never stop learning!</p>

  <p>Thank you for reading! üôè</p>
